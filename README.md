-----------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this project was to identify trends that may have appeared in the winners of medals at the Summer Olympics between 1976 and 2008.

Categories include gender, country, location, political regime change, and individual athletes. 

Questions asked include finding the medal points of countries of interest by sport and year, did they perform as expected and were there any areas that sparked interest for further investigation, was there any noticeable change in performance among the top 4 countries, finding the distribution of genders of athlete, and the most decorated Athlete, and is there a correlation between a countryâ€™s performance as the host country vs as a visiting country?

We needed a CSV file that contained medalist data from 1976 to 2008 and we found a CSV that fit this description on Kaggle.
We grabbed an additional CSV file to add the host nation to the data we were working with.

Our final analysis and our final presentation are included as PDF files.
